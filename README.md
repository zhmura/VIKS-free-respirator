# VIKS-free-respirator

![`Final result sample`](final-result-sample/photos/respirator-v2-with-filters.jpg)

## Project purposes?
The idea is to design the scheme of production of respirator capable with any kind of filter 
based on `ISO 5367` connection port. The process of making this respirator should be simple, 
based on the materials available on public market and safe for the end user.

## Features
1. ISO-connector capable nozzles
2. Reusable
3. Disinfectable (ultraviolet, liquid disinfectants)
4. Can be assembled at home 
5. Available materials
6. Open sources

## Who can use such a respirator mask?
The respirator can be used by anyone who can produce it and whom it fits to. Also see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)

## How to make this mask?
See [`production description`](PRODUCTION_DESC.md)

## What filters to use?
COVID-19 case: I suggest any type of filter with virus protection (See also [`SMS filtering`](https://www.textileinnovations.co.uk/latest-news/what-is-sms-or-spunbond-meltblown-spunbond/))
You can design and create your own filter too based on this principle.

## Is this respirator model certified?
No it is not. User can use this device `at his own risk`. It is a solution for the cases when no other 
individual protection means available for the user.
