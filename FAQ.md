# Project purposes?
The idea is to design the scheme of production of respirator capable with any kind of filter 
based on ISO 5367 connection port. The process of making this respirator should be simple, 
based on the materials available on public market and safe for the end user.

#Who can use such a respirator?
The respirator can be used by anyone who can produce it and whom it fits to.

#Is this respirator model certified?
No it is not. User can use this device at his own risk. It is a solution for the cases when no other 
individual protection means available for the user.
